## This is only a wrapper of the ga-extractor npm package and is not really usable with meteor...
## However I created andruschka:ga-fetcher for fetching data from google analytics in a synchronous way !!!
  
# ga-extractor packed for Meteor
ga-extractor bulk-extracts Google Analytics (GA) raw data using the Core Reporting API. Use it as part of your ETL process.  
ga-extractor was spun off from bower-server-etl, the ETL service that feeds Bower's registry.  
Will provide ```GaExtractor``` Namespace.

```
meteor install andruschka:ga-extractor
```
